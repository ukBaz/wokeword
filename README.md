# Friendly Words

## Background
On my desktop PC I use a little program I've written to help me come up with
ideas for naming projects, machines, etc where I just need some inspiration.
Often I don't take exactly what the generator gives me, but it is often a good
start.

The script comes up with a little saying based on some word lists. If you have
ever seen how what3words end up with some very embarrassing and inappropriate
names for things using a similar technique then you know the pitfalls of such
a scheme. That is why this uses the curated word lists from 
https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words

Anyway, the other day I wanted to use the script, but I wasn't by my
desktop PC, so I've turned the program in to a simple web page
(Flask app) that gives me the suggestions anywhere I have access to the web.

Currently, this is running at:
